  storyText: When you follow the tracks, you see a deer drinking water. It's defenceless.
    What are you gonna do?
  choice1Text: 'Use your bow '
  choice2Text: You're a young man. Run at him with your spear.
  result1: You manage to take him down in one hit. Then you tie him up with a rope
    and return home.
  result2: As soon as you take your first step, you step on a twig and the deer disappears
    in a second. You return home empty-handed because it's too late.
